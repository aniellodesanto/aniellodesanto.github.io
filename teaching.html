<h2>Digital Humanities  </h2>
<ul class="skill-list">
<li>Alongside my research interest, I care deeply about the pedagogical connections between social sciences, humanities, and computer science.
I am also interested in establishing bridges between academia and industry, and preparing students for successful careers in both.
If you are a student and need advice in this sense, get in touch!</li>
<li> In summer 2020 I was a co-instructor for the course Topics in Computational Linguistics (together with Alena Aksenova, Jeff Heinz, and Thomas Graf) at the New York - St. Petersburg Institute of Linguistics, Cognition, and Culture (VNYI 2020, held online).</li>

<h2>Joining the MeLo Lab</h2>
<p  style="text-align:justify">
If you are interested in undergraduate or graduate study in computation, cognition, and language, this is the lab for you!
 You can check a list of current lab members <A HREF="https://aniellodesanto.github.io/MeLo/">here</A>, and recent publications <A HREF="../publications">here</A> or <A HREF="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bzk5U9IAAAAJ&hl=en">here</A>).
Note that you do not necessarily need computational skills when starting in the lab! In fact, I welcome and value different backgrounds!
But you will be expected to gain some (with my help!!) as you go along.
</p>


<ul class="skill-list">
<li><b>Honors/UROP Students </b>. If you are interested in writing an honors thesis in the lab, please get in touch with me at least two/three semesters prior to your anticipated graduation date.
I consider proposals to write theses in the lab upon completion of at least one semester of lab engagement. For UROP proposals, I advice to get in touch at least three months before the proposal is due (e.g. at the beginning of the Fall for a Spring proposal, etc.).</li>

<li><b>Graduate Students </b>. Before getting in touch with me, I strongly advise you to read some of my most recent publications. You can connect with me via email, with a brief description of your research interests and your ideas about how those connect with the work that I do. 
Generally, I am happy to offer advice/chat about whether my lab would be a good fit for you! But be aware that admissions are done at the central department level, and in no way conversations with me can guarantee you a spot!</li>
