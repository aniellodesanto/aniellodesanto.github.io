<h2>CV</h2>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Currently, I am a second year student in the Linguistics Department. 
While my specific research interests are still in divenire,
I am mainly oriented towards topics dealing with mathematical linguistics,
theoretical syntax and computational psycho/neurolinguistics.
</p>

<p>
Generally, I am intrigued by how insights from Math and Computer Science
can help investigations in theoretical and experimental linguistics.
On one side, I am interested in how notions from Formal Language Theory 
(e.g. complexity, leanability, generative capacity)
can help shed light on structural and formal properties of Natural Language
independent of framework-specific implementational details (e.g. new computational universals).
On the other side, I believe that a formal understanding of the computational requirements
of the Language system can offer a solid theoretical support
both to the design of new experiments in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics
(e.g. online sentence processing, possible/impossible grammars),
and to the use of  experimental results  in linguistic theories
(e.g. reducing the complexity class of natural languages due to processing requirements).
</p>

<h2>Past Affiliations</h2>
<p>
In a previous life, I got a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering
(with a specialization in Automation and Complex System Theory)
 and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, both from the University of Pavia, Italy.
 I also was a RA assistant at the University of Naples "Federico II", where I worked on modeling user
 interactions on Online Social Networks, and NLP techniques applied to Healthcare systems.
