<h2>Research</h2>
<p>I am currently a second year student in the Linguistics Department at Stony Brook University. 
My advisor is  <A HREF="http://thomasgraf.net/">Thomas Graf</A>.
</p>

<p>
While my specific research interests are still in divenire,
I am mainly oriented towards topics dealing with mathematical linguistics,
theoretical syntax and computational psycho/neurolinguistics. 

</p>

<p>
Generally, I am intrigued by how insights from Math and Computer Science
can help investigations in theoretical and experimental linguistics.
On one side, I am interested in how notions from Formal Language Theory 
(e.g. complexity, leanability, generative capacity)
can help shed light on structural and formal properties of Natural Language
independent of framework-specific implementational details (e.g. new computational universals).
In this sense, I find great value in working with well-defined grammatical formalisms such as MGs and TAGs.

On the other side, I believe that a formal understanding of the computational requirements
of the Language system can offer a solid theoretical support
both to the design of new experiments in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics
(e.g. online sentence processing, possible/impossible grammars),
and to the use of  experimental results  in linguistic theories
(e.g. reducing the complexity class of natural languages due to processing requirements).
</p>

<p>
One recent interest of mine is in understanding the cognitive reality of the Chomsky Hierarchy (and Subregular Hierarchy).
</p>

<h2>Past Affiliations</h2>
<p>
In a previous life, I studied to become an Automation Engineer.
I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Pavia (Italy), with a thesis on 
the identification of models for the automatic control of an Artificial Pancreas.
 </p>
 <p>
I then got a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (again from the University of Pavia),
with a specialization in Automation and Complex System Theory.

My Master's Thesis was partially written during a Research Internship in the Multimedia Systems Lab of the University of Naples "Federico II", where
I developed a probabilistic framework for the detection of unexplained user behaviors in online social networks.
 </p>
 <p>
After my graduation I spent one year as a RA assistant at the University of Naples "Federico II", where I kept working on modeling Online Social Network's user interactions, and 
on NLP techniques applied to Healthcare systems.

<h2>Stony Brook Misc</h2>
<p>
Together with <A HREF="http://www.aaksenova.com/">Alëna Aksënova</A>, I am
the student organizer of Stony Brook's <A HREF="http://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/">Mathematical Linguistics Reading Group</A>.

This is an informal group that meets every week for about an hour to explore various ways in which
mathematics informs our view of language and it is intended to be a multidisciplinary venue to discuss awesome research ideas.
Topics we've covered in the past are model theoretic syntax, game theory, dynamic semantics, and modal logic.
