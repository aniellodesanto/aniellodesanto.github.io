<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Currently, I am a second year student in the Linguistics Department. 
While my specific research interests are still in divenire,
I am mainly oriented towards topics dealing with mathematical linguistics,
theoretical syntax and computational psycho/neurolinguistics.
</p>

<p>
Generally, I am intrigued by how insights from Math and Computer Science
can help investigations in theoretical and experimental linguistics.
On one side, I am interested in how notions from Formal Language Theory 
(e.g. complexity, leanability, generative capacity)
can help shed light on structural and formal properties of Natural Language
independent of framework-specific implementational details (e.g. new computational universals).
On the other side, I believe that a formal understanding of the computational requirements
of the Language system can offer a solid theoretical support
both to the design of new experiments in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics
(e.g. online sentence processing, possible/impossible grammars),
and to the use of  experimental results  in linguistic theories
(e.g. reducing the complexity class of natural languages due to processing requirements).
</p>

<h2>Past Affiliations</h2>
<p>
In a previous life, I got a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering
(with a specialization in Automation and Complex System Theory)
 and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, both from the University of Pavia, Italy.
 I also was a RA assistant at the University of Naples "Federico II", where I worked on modeling user
 interactions on Online Social Networks, and NLP techniques applied to Healthcare systems.

<h2>Stony Brook Misc</h2>
<p>
Together with <A HREF="http://www.aaksenova.com/">Alëna Aksënova</A>, I am
the student organizer of Stony Brook's <A HREF="http://complab-stonybrook.github.io/mlrg/">Mathematical Linguistics Reading Group</A>.

This is an informal group that meets every week for about an hour to explore various ways in which
mathematics informs our view of language and it is intended to be a multidisciplinary venue to discuss awesome research ideas.
Topics we've covered in the past are model theoretic syntax, game theory, dynamic semantics, and modal logic.
